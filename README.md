This repository provides open access to data analyzed in the article, "A Synthesis of Quantitative Research on Programs For Struggling Readers in Elementary Schools".

## Abstract
This article reviews research on the outcomes of diverse reading approaches on the achievement of struggling readers in elementary schools. Sixty-one studies of 48 different programs met rigorous standards. Eighty-four percent were randomized experiments and 16% quasi-experiments. Outcomes were positive for one-to-one tutoring and were positive but not as large for one-to-small group tutoring. There were no differences in outcomes between teachers and teaching assistants as tutors. Whole-class approaches (mostly cooperative learning) and whole-class/whole-school approaches incorporating tutoring for struggling readers obtained outcomes for struggling readers as large as those found for tutoring, and benefitted many more students. Technology-supported adaptive instruction did not have significant positive outcomes for struggling readers, however. The article concludes that approaches supplementing classroom and school instructional enhancements with tutoring for the most at-risk students have the greatest potential for the largest numbers of struggling readers.
